Get a list of artists tagged with a personal tag on last.fm

I'm tagging the list of bands that I've seen in concert with the 'seen live' tag on last.fm. As the current last.fm beta doesn't have an easy/obvious way to access tags (or get the list of artists tagged with 'seen live', for that matter), I've hacked this little script together.
